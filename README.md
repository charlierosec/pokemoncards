# Pokémon Card Database

## About
I am a very dedicated Pokémon Card collector.
I have created this project as a way to organize my thousands of cards and learn
more about website development. Originally I had a large spreadsheet, however 
this didn't have all the usabilty that I would have preferred. Now I am in the 
process of taking my spreadsheet and turning into a website I can access anywhere.

## Credits
