# Pokémon Card Database

## About
I am a very dedicatd Pokémon Card collector.
I have created this project as a way to organize my thousands of cards and learn more about website development.
Originally I had a large spreadsheet, however this didn't have all the usabilty that I would have preferred.
Now I am in the process of taking my spreadsheet and turning into a website I can access anywhere.

## Scripts
I have written a few scripts in here for .csv files.
While these were intended for the specific usage to this project, a few of them can apply to other situations

## Credits
Most, if not all images were gotten from [Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page "Bulbapedia Homepage").
Any images recieved from other locations or created by me have been marked.
