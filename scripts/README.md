These scripts are not great. In fact, they're probably very bad. However,
this was my first time using awk outside the classroom and I want to 
immortalize my first awk programs.

Usages because I will forget

```
awk -F "," -f removelast2.awk INPUTFILE
```

`removelast1.awk` runs on a directory using `operateawk.sh`
